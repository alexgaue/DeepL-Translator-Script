# DeepL-Translator-Script

## Description
This repository contains a Python script that uses the DeepL API to translate text from one language to another. I wrote it to help me automate the process of creating Anki flashcards.

## Usage
1. Install the `deepl` Python package using `pip install deepl`.
2. Place your source text file in the root directory of this project or specify the path.
3. Set the `input_filepath` to your source text file and `output_filepath` to your desired output file in the script.
4. Run the script using `python translate.py`.

## API Key
The script requires a valid DeepL API key to function. Replace the placeholder key in the script with your actual DeepL API key.

## Disclaimer
This script is for educational purposes and to demonstrate the usage of the DeepL API with Python. Please adhere to DeepL's API usage policies and guidelines.
